# Legendary
Legendary is a game still a WIP, is being developed using the beloved Unity3D Engine using the not so beloved C# (Thanks, Microsoft!).
It is inspired by a retro arcade game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kage">The Legend Of Kage</a> and the masterpiece, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosadventure&hl=en">alto's adventure</a>. We are building a simple arcade-platformer game.<br><br>

# The Story
We simply started with analysing the current trends in the arcade / casual games on android and ios, we found out an awful amount games were similar to what we used to play on video games.

So we decided to make reboot of a popular arcade game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kage">The Legend Of Kage</a>,
But unfortunaetly it did'nt have much of a gameplay, it had no plot, the game design was really repetitive, and it game had no sense of progress the only thing it did right was that, it was fun which is in fact the purpose why we play video games.

Then we started thinking about a plot, an environment setting, the game mechanics and a secondary character (because, who likes to play alone, right?).

After some of hours of doodling around, playing old arcade games and watching some game design tutorials we ended up this:  <br>

<p>
The story is extremely simple, <i>Yuko</i>'s pet <i>Nya</i> is kidnapped by the evil king <i>Aku no</i>, So she went on journey to save <i>Nya</i> from the evil king with the help of <i>Neko</i>. After drafting this much story we begin the development part.<br>
